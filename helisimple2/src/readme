Version 0.5

This simple app reads image from the AR Drone 2.0 and displays it on the screen.
If you click an object with distinct color, it will start to search for a largest object of that color in the image.
Pressing R makes the app forget the tracked color.

Q and A are takeoff and land, keypad numbers move the drone.
Z,X changes a camera.
Pressing ENTER saves current image. 

If you have a joystick, buttons 7 and 5 takeoff and land, buttons 1-4 switch cameras.
Axes 0-3 change angles and height.

The code is commented inside, start with main/heli.cpp so see how it works. 

COMPILING

Just type ''make'' in the src directory.
The soft needs standard libraries, SDL-devel lib for GUI and ffmpeg (libavcodec,libswscale) for video processing.

ISSUES

Make sure your firewall accepts UDP and TCP connections on relevant ports - i.e. 5557 for UDP and 5555 for TPC.
The image bottom 8 rows part are incorrectly decoded - I have left them out for now.
