drone\_project
=============

Implement autopilot to Parrot AR.Drone to allow it to move from point A to point B avoiding all the obstacles.

Install ROS
-----------
First you need to install ROS to use this project.
The version we use is groovy. Just follow the instructions on the webpage: wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation (tip: there is a link to download a virtual machine for virtualbox with ROS already installed)
If you choose to install on your own OS (not with virtualbox), just follow the instructions, and install the desktop-full version of ROS.

You can take a look to some tutorials to understand what is ROS and what it's made of: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials
