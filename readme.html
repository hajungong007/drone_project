<h1>drone_project</h1>

<p>Implement autopilot to Parrot AR.Drone to allow it to move from point A to point B avoiding all the obstacles.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Pre-requirements</h3>

<h4>Install ROS</h4>

<p>First you need to install ROS to use this project.
The version we use is groovy. Just follow the instructions on the <a href="wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation">webpage</a> (tip: there is a link to download a virtual machine for virtualbox with ROS already installed)
If you choose to install on your own OS (not with virtualbox), just follow the instructions, and install the desktop-full version of ROS.</p>

<p>You can take a look to some <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials">tutorials</a> to understand what is ROS and what it's made of.</p>

<h4>Install ardrone_autonomy driver</h4>

<p>It's the driver to interface the ARDrone with ROS.
